# BAL - Balancer Governance Token

Since inception, our goal at Balancer Labs has been to decentralize and diversify governance of the [Balancer Protocol](http://balancer.finance/). We have looked into several approaches and designs, and have landed on an approach we are proud to share: the Balancer Protocol Governance Token \(BAL\).

We believe alignment between token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance. More explicitly, we believe BAL tokens are the vehicle to drive alignment and participation in the protocol. BAL tokens are not an investment; BAL token holders should be people that interface with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table.

### Balancer’s Most Important Stakeholders: Liquidity Providers <a id="6f3a"></a>

As a recap, Balancer protocol allows any Ethereum address to add liquidity in the form of tokens to existing Balancer pools, or even create their own pools.

Liquidity attracts traders, trading generates fees, and ultimately pool profitability attracts more liquidity. This is a flywheel effect that we are beginning to see happen within Balancer protocol.

Regardless of the venue, early liquidity providers take on more risks and opportunity costs: contract risk, low initial pool profitability, etc. We believe that these protocol users should get to participate early on in deciding how the protocol evolves. This is Balancer Labs proposed and implemented the concept of liquidity mining: Balancer governance tokens \(BALs\) are distributed to liquidity providers. See below for more details.

### Future Balancer Versions and Governance Token <a id="ffb5"></a>

Balancer V1 launched without a native token, and confirmed our assumption that Balancer’s approach would resonate with the community. However, in order for the protocol to keep up with the fast evolving Ethereum and DeFi space, we are convinced that many new versions and continuous development of the protocol will be essential.

BALs are a key way of decentralizing the governance of the protocol such that it can remain resilient over time, protected from the failure of any single stakeholder. Our governance needs to be as resilient as our technology infrastructure.

We expect token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation, for example: implementing new functionalities, deploying the protocol on additional smart contract blockchains other than Ethereum, using layer 2 solutions for scaling, introducing a protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the BAL token holders for review.

### Token Supply and Distribution <a id="14a8"></a>

The total supply of BAL tokens will be 100M. 25M BAL tokens are initially allocated to founders, core devs, advisors and investors, all subject to vesting periods.

The remaining 75M tokens are intended to be mostly distributed to liquidity providers in the coming years. In the future, and with governance approval, tokens may also be distributed to strategic partners in order to foster the development of the protocol and its ecosystem.

Every week 145,000 BALs, or approximately 7.5M per year, are distributed to liquidity providers. This means in the first year of BAL’s existence there would be 30% supply inflation off the initially allocated supply of 25M tokens. This high rate of supply inflation is meant to kickstart the distribution of governance rights of the protocol out to those who earn it.

The schedule of BAL distribution for the following years is going to be extensively discussed by the Balancer community, and we plan for it to ultimately be decided by BAL holders.
