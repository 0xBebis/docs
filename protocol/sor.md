# SOR

Smart Order Router, henceforth known as SOR is an off-chain linear optimization of routing orders across pools for best price execution.

SOR exists in the Bronze release as a way to aggregate liquidity across all Balancer pools. Future releases of Balancer will accomplish this on-chain and allow aggregate contract fillable liqudity.
